This program puts a 4 digit decimal integer into the eax register and generates 4 bytes in the 
ebx register that correspond to the ascii characters representing the integer.

For example if it starts with the integer 1234 in the eax register, it will have the bytes 0x31 0x32 0x33 0x34 in the b register when it finishes.

The value is returned as the return value of the program, however as return values roll over after 255 echoing $? will not return the expected number. The best way to verify this is working is running it with gdb (gdb ./int2ascii), setting a break point at end (gdb command: break end), running the program in gdb (gdb command: r), and inspecting the ebx register (gdb command: i r ebx). This will output the contents of the ebx register.
